# Web Page Project

Built a web page from scratch themed after my hometown Los Angeles. In this project, I included the photos I have taken from my adventures around my city as well as lists of the places I have visited and places that I wish to visit one day. 

I created different buttons representing  tabs and a button that pops up a modal window when pressed. The user can close the modal window by either clicking outside the modal window's screen, pressing the escape ('Esc') key, or pressing the exit ('X') button.



This project was created for fun and, most importantly, to practice DOM manipulation  

# Languages/tools used:
* JavaScript
* CSS
* HTML
* Bootstrap (used for the style/design of the web page and buttons)
